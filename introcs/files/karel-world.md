## Karel's World

Karel lives in a grid world. Each point on the grid is marked by a dot, and is a location that Karel can be in.

The world has streets and avenues. The streets run horizontally and the avenues run vertically. The first street is the first row at the bottom of the grid, and the first avenue is the leftmost column of the grid.

Karel can face four different directions.
