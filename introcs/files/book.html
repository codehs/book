## Introduction to Programming with Karel the Dog 

In this chapter we are going to introduce you to programming with Karel the Dog. Programming is the process of
giving instructions to a computer, which is similar to the way you can give commands to a dog. 

### What is Karel?

Karel is a dog that lives in a grid world. Karel can move around the grid world and put down and take tennis balls,
and we can use Karel to solve different problems and explore the basics of programming.

# Commands in Karel

Karel can move around the grid world and put down and take tennis balls. In order to get Karel to do something,
you need to give karel a command. A command is an instruction for an action that Karel can do.

Karel only knows four commands:

    move();
    putBall();
    takeBall();
    turnLeft();
    
These are the only four words that Karel understands. 

## What does each command do?

The `move()` command moves Karel one spot in the direction that Karel is facing.

The `putBall()` command puts down one tennis ball in the spot that Karel is currently in.

The `takeBall()` command removes one tennis ball from the spot that Karel is currently in.

The `turnLeft()` command turns Karel 90 degrees to the left. 

## The parts of a command

There are a few important things to note when you write a command. 

* You need to write the command exactly as it appears

* You need to match the exact capitalization

move(); is different than Move();

* Make sure to end every command with a `();`

This is how Karel can understand the command.

* Each command goes on its own line.
